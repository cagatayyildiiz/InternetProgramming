 This beet and cabbage red soup is a delicious belly warmer on Moscow's colder days, served with or without meat, potato, herbs (usually dill) and a dollop of smetana, Russian sour cream.
 Accompanied with a piece of rye bread or garlic bread topped with melted cheese, this dish is hearty enough to serve as a meal, although it is usually eaten as a starter.
 A staple of Russia cuisine, it would be an offense to leave Moscow without trying this soup at least once– although its surprisingly tasty flavour will certainly leave you wishing you had tried more local variations.
 Other common Russian soups to try are ukha, a seasoned fish and vegetable broth, and schi, a cabbage-based broth.

 Blini are Russia's version of the thin French crêpe and a staple on most Moscovian menus, typically made with buckwheat for savoury fillings or white flour for sweet toppings.
 You'll see accompaniments of smoked salmon, creamy mushrooms, sour cream, jams and condensed milk– to name a few– but the high-end, revered combination is a spoonful of red salmon or black sturgeon caviar.
 Another tasty Russian pancake is the cottage cheese version called syrniki, a denser form of ricotta-pancakes, which are eaten for breakfast or dessert. 
 They're best served with homemade jams made from Russia's large array of berries, although condensed milk, honey and sour cream are also served as condiments.

 This hardly needs mentioning seeing as ‘Russian salad' is one such dish that has spread internationally, and chances are you've tried a version in your home country.
 However, the Russian version is fresher and crispier with a light smattering of mayonnaise– quite the opposite to the ratio of the soft-boiled, mayonnaise-heavy international versions.
 This could be due to the use of fresh cucumber or crunchy Russian pickles, although the base of diced potato, peas, egg and mayonnaise/sour cream remains ubiquitous. In Moscow, however, it's known as Olivier salad, named after the chef Lucien Olivier who created the ‘secret' recipe there around the mid-1800s, although the original ingredients have been swapped for cheaper, more available foods. 
 You'll also find a variation of similar cold Russian salads that will equally vie for your attention.
