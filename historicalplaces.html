<h2> The Kremlin</h2>
<p ><font size="3">
 The Moscow Kremlin is one of the most ancient parts of the city and symbolises the whole of Russia. 
 It is both a cultural sight, as well as the centre of the Russian state, and the residence of the President of Russia. The Kremlin is steeped in history. 
 In 1990, the Moscow Kremlin and the Red Square were included into the list of UNESCO worldwide heritage.
 There are many tours offered around the Kremlin, and various museums are located inside the complex, such as the Armory Chamber, Cathedral of the Annunciation,
 Cathedral of the Archangel, Cathedral of the Assumption, the Patriarch’s chambers, Church of the Deposition of the Robe, Ivan the Great Bell Ensemble, Sobornaya square, and “Archeology of the Moscow Kremlin” collection.

 <h1> Red Square </h1>
<p ><font size="4">
Red Square remains, as it has been for centuries, the heart and soul of Russia. Few places in the world bear the weight of history to the extent that Moscow's central square does. 
From the 16th Century St. Basil's Cathedral - one of the most famous pieces of architecture in the world - to the constructivist pyramid of Lenin's Mausoleum, Red Square is rich in symbols of Russia's turbulent and intriguing past.

<h1> Moscow Metro</h1>
<p > <font size="4">
The Moscow metro is famous for its architecture and the stations called “underground palaces of Moscow” have become main sights of the city.

The old, pre-war stations symbolise the industrialisation of Russia, whereas the post-war ones were made to symbolise victory and pride of the nation. The first metro line was the Sokolnicheskaya, built in 1935. "Majakovskaya" is considered one of the most beautiful stations. But also, "Revolution Square", "Kropotkinskaya", "Komsomolskaya", "Novoslobodskaya" are considered the most interesting architectural monuments of 1930-1950.

Some of them are also protected by the state as valuable cultural objects. The underground complexes are decorated by statues, monuments and art such as paintings, mosaics, and stained-glass windows. The idea was to give every station an individual shape and appearance.
